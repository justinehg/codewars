# Coding Challenges

A collection of Javascript coding challenges and my solutions. 

### General format

```js
/* 
Problem a.k.a Prompt
*/

/* 
Solution
*/

function something() {
  // do something
}
```
## Lessons Learned:

For the past few months, I've been challenging myself with Leetcode and Codewars problems every day.   The possibilities for learning are limitless and it's amazing to see that there are a huge variety of solutions for a single problem. With the goal of working on Codewars  on a daily basis, this help me become more knowledgeable with JavaScript and discover new ways to solve challenges.

#### Optimizations 

I would like to go back to completed problems again, review them, then see how to improve codes readability. 

## Process

- If it is the first time solution, use `add first solution` commit
- If the solution is changed, use `add updated solution` commit
